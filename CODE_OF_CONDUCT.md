# CDK Open Source Maintainer Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines expectations for maintenance and maintainers of CDK-managed open source communities, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all, and your role as a maintainer is essential to this goal.

As a maintainer you establish the guidelines for your community and enforce those guidelines according to the rules set forth in the CDK contributor code of conduct. This means taking any report of a contributor code of conduct violation seriously. The reporter is owed a thorough and fair review of their complaint. If you determine that the behavior that they reported is not a violation, communicate that clearly to them and explain why you’re not going to take action on it. What they do with that is up to them: tolerate the behavior that they had an issue with, or stop participating in the community.

A report of behavior that doesn’t actually violate the contributor code of conduct may still indicate that there is a problem in the community. In such cases, you may want to revise the code of conduct to clarify acceptable behavior and/or talk to the person whose behavior was reported (which may involve telling them that while they did not violate the code of conduct, they are skirting the edge of what is expected and are making certain participants feel uncomfortable).

As a maintainer, you enforce and set the tone for the standards for acceptable behavior. You have the ability to shape the community’s values of a project, and participants expect you to enforce those values in a fair and even-handed way.

When a project seems hostile or unwelcoming, even if it’s just one person whose behavior is tolerated by others, you risk losing many more contributors. It’s not always easy to adopt or enforce a code of conduct, but it will help your community grow.
