# CDK Open Source Contributor Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines expectations for participation in CDK-managed open source communities, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. People violating this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

Our open source communities strive to:

- Be friendly and patient – Remember you might not be communicating in someone else's primary spoken or programming language, and others may not have your level of understanding.
- Be welcoming – Our communities welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
- Be respectful – We are a world-wide community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners.
- Understand disagreements – Disagreements, both social and technical, are useful learning opportunities. Seek to understand the other viewpoints and resolve differences constructively.
- This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to capture our common understanding of a productive, collaborative environment. We expect the code to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all communities for CDK-managed open source projects, regardless of whether the project explicitly calls out its use of this code. The code also applies in public spaces when an individual is representing a project or its community. Examples include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Curation

Open sourcing too many projects that get little attention or resources can end up being counter-productive. As a rule, we prefer to share those projects that have been internally tested, used and validated, and where we think a big impact can be made.

If a project is bound to receive less attention in the future, we commit to communicating that to our users clearly. Whenever possible, we try to find them new curators.

## Reporting Code of Conduct Issues

We encourage all communities to resolve issues on their own whenever possible. This builds a broader and deeper understanding and ultimately a healthier interaction. In the event that an issue cannot be resolved locally, please feel free to report your concerns by either logging them or contacting a maintainer as appropriate.

In your report please include:

- Your contact information.
- Names (real, usernames or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well.
- Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (such as a public chat log), please include a link or attachment.
- Any additional information that may be helpful.

All reports will be reviewed by our team and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Where additional perspectives are needed, the team may seek insight from others with relevant expertise or experience. The confidentiality of the person reporting the incident will be kept at all times. Involved parties are never part of the review team.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the review team may take any action they deem appropriate, including a permanent ban from the community.

This code of conduct is based on the template established by the TODO Group and used by numerous other communities (e.g., [Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/pages/876921332402685/open-source-code-of-conduct), [Microsoft](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/), [Twitter](https://engineering.twitter.com/opensource/code-of-conduct), [Yahoo](https://yahoo.github.io/codeofconduct)).
